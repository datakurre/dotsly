- You'll see a **blue highlighted area** showing what's selected
- The **crosshair cursor** indicates you're in selection mode

## Moving Selected Content

### Method 1: Arrow Keys (Recommended)

Once you have a selection active:

- **↑ Arrow Up** - Move selection up by 1 cell

- **← Arrow Left** - Move selection left by 1 cell
- **→ Arrow Right** - Move selection right by 1 cell

### Method 2: Cut and Paste

1. **Ctrl+X** - Cut the selected area (removes it and copies to clipboard)
2. Click where you want to place it
3. **Ctrl+V** - Paste at the new location

### Method 3: Copy and Paste (keeps original)

1. **Ctrl+C** - Copy the selected area (keeps original, copies to clipboard)

## Rotating Selected Content

### Rotate Selection

- **R** - Rotate selection counterclockwise (90° left)

**Important**:

- Rotation only works when you have an **active selection** (blue highlighted area)
- First select an area, then press R or Shift+R to rotate
- Rotation works best with square selections. Non-square selections may have limitations.
